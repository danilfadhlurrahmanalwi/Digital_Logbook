# Digital Logbook
#### Year Accomplished : Expected to finish June 2025 (Final Graduation Project)
#### Role/Position : UI/UX Designer and Full-Stack Developer
#### Project Description
This project is my final graduation project. In this project, I created a digital logbook that makes it easier for technicians to fill out their logbooks digitally through a web-based platform. Previously, the logbook was only recorded manually in physical books, which could only be accessed when in the office, and it was difficult to search for past data. This project is equipped with features such as login, registration, dashboard, Excel data export, and user role management where there are admin and regular users. Only the admin has the ability to add new users. On the logbook update page in the dashboard, I also added a filter feature to make it easier to search data by date and type of work. I developed this project using the Laravel framework, designed the website using Figma, and used MySQL as the database. The project is currently 40% complete and is expected to be fully finished by August.
